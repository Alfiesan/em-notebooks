    "This is a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org), an interactive computing environment. Each cell is executable code. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use the notebook:\n",
    "- \"Shift + Enter\" runs the code within the cell (so does the forward arrow button near the top of the document)\n",
    "- You can alter variables and re-run cells\n",
    "- If you want to start with a clean slate, restart the Kernel either by going to the top, clicking on Kernel: Restart, or by \"esc + 00\" (if you do this, you will need to re-run the following block of code before running any other cells in the notebook) \n",
