EM Notebooks
============

A collection of notebooks that use the electromagnetics (EM) module of
`SimPEG <http://simpeg.xyz>`_. Many of these notebooks reproduce examples
from `EM GeoSci <http://em.geosci.xyz>`_, an open source "textbook" on applied
electromagnetics.

If you build upon these notebooks in your work, please cite:

- `(Heagy et al., 2016) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00804>`_: *A framework for simulation and inversion in electromagnetics*


These notebooks are available on binders!
